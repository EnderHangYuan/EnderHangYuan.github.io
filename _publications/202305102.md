#excerpt: 'Nanocellulose paper (nanopaper) has been widely applied as a promising substrate for biomedical due to its low cost, biocompatibility and high optical transparency. In this report, we first reported surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) immunoassay on the nanopaper-based analytical microfluidic devices (NanoPADs). We detected glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in human plasma without pretreatment using SERS on NanoPADs for highly sensitive early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. For SERS detection, DTNB-labeled uniform gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were utilized as tags. Additionally, in-situ silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used as SERS substrates. We detected different concentrations of GFAP and determined the limit of detection as 150 fg/mL, which was 100 times better than commercial analytical techniques.'
