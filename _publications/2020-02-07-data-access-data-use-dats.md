### Abstract
#### Background

Data reuse is often controlled to protect the privacy of subjects and patients. Data discovery tools need ways to inform researchers about restrictions on data access and re-use.

#### Results

We present elements in the Data Tags Suite (DATS) metadata schema describing data access, data use conditions, and consent information. DATS metadata are explained in terms of the administrative, legal, and technical systems used to protect confidential data.

#### Conclusions

The access and use metadata items in DATS are designed from the perspective of a researcher who wants to find and re-use existing data. We call for standard ways of describing informed consent and data use agreements that will enable automated systems for managing research data.
