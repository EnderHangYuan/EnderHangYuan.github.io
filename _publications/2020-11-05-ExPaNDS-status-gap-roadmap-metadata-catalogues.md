### Abstract

The [ExPaNDS project](https://expands.eu/) aims at deploying into EOSC Data Catalogues and data analysis services. This document describes the status, a gap analysis, and a roadmap required to achieve harmonised and federated (meta)data catalogues within EOSC of the participating national Photon and Neutron (PaN) Research Infrastructures (RIs).
