### Abstract

We present the milestone achieved for a metadata catalogue release in the domain of photon and neutron (PaN) science. With the primary goal of supporting PaN FAIR data catalogue services, we have developed a self-contained, stand-alone metadata catalogue release that facilities can download to test/try and play with. The work represents the achievement of milestone MS12 of the Horizon 2020 ExPaNDS project.
