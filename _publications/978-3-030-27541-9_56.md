#excerpt: 'Advanced service robots and flexible production lines demand more universal grippers than conventional ones. In response to the deficiencies of Omnigripper proposed by previous scholars, this paper proposes a novel hedgehog-inspired robot hand (HIPA Hand) with multiple magnetic pins for general self-adaptive grasping. The HIPA hand utilizes electromagnets as the main driving part and the motor as another driving part. HIPA hand can grasp the object of different sizes and shapes. The theoretical analysis and simulation experimental results show that this device has a special advantage of quick grasping and big grasping force compared with the traditional pin-array grippers.'
