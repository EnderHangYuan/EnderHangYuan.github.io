#excerpt: 'Metal-coated lattice structures hold significant promise for customizing mechanical properties in diverse industrial applications, including the mechanical arms of unmanned aerial vehicles. However, their intricate geometries pose computational challenges, resulting in time-intensive and costly numerical evaluations. This study introduces a parameterization-based multiscale method to analyze body-centered cubic lattice structures with metal coatings. We establish the validity and precision of our proposed method with a comparative analysis of numerical results at the Representative Volume Element (RVE) scale and experimental findings, specifically addressing both elastic tensile and bending stiffness. Furthermore, we showcase the methodâ€™s accuracy in interpreting the bending stiffness of coated lattice structures using a homogenized material-based solid model, underscoring its effectiveness in predicting the elastic properties of such structures. In exploring the mechanical characterization of coated lattice structures, we unveil positive correlations between elastic tensile stiffness and both coating thickness and strut diameter. Additionally, the metal coating significantly enhances the structural elastic bending stiffness multiple times over. The diverse failure patterns observed in coated lattices under tensile and bending loads primarily stem from varied loading-induced stress states rather than external factors. This work not only mitigates computational challenges but also successfully bridges the gap between mesoscale RVE mechanical properties and those at the global structural scale.'
