I am a member of the [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) [COVID-19 Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-covid19).

The overarching objectives of this Working Group (WG) are:

- to clearly define detailed guidelines on data sharing under the present COVID-19 circumstances to help stakeholders follow best practices to maximize the efficiency of their work,

- to develop guidelines for policymakers to maximise timely data sharing and appropriate responses in such health emergencies, and

- to address the interests of researchers, policy makers, funders, publishers, and providers of data sharing infrastructures.
