#excerpt: 'The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of online learning and teaching in many colleges and universities. Video, as a key integral part of online education, largely influences student learning experiences. Though many guidelines on designing educational videos have been reported, the quantitative data showing the impacts of video length on students’ academic performance in a credit-bearing course is limited, particularly for an online-flipped college engineering course. The forced pandemic lockdown enables a suitable environment to address this research gap. In this paper, we present the first step to examine the impact of short videos on students’ academic performance in such circumstances. Our results indicate that short videos can greatly improve student engagement by 24.7% in terms of video viewing time, and the final exam score by 9.0%, both compared to the long-video group. The quantitative Likert questionnaire also indicates students’ preference for short videos over long videos. We believe this study has important implications for course design for future online-flipped engineering courses.'
