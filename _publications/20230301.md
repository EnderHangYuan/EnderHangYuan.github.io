#excerpt: 'Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanolayers are one of the most promising two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials for constructing next-generation field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. In this article, we report an ultrasensitive FET biosensor that integrates a novel format of 2D MoS2, vertically-aligned MoS2 nanolayers (VAMNs), as the channel material for label-free detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The developed VAMNs-based FET biosensor shows two distinctive advantages. First, the VAMNs can be facilely grown using the conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, permitting easy fabrication and potential mass device production. Second, the unique advantage of the VAMNs for biosensor development lies in its abundant surface-exposed active edge sites that possess a high binding affinity with thiol-based linkers, which overcomes the challenge of molecule functionalization on the conventional planar MoS2 nanolayers. The high binding affinity between 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and the VAMNs was demonstrated through experimental surface characterization and theoretical calculations via density functional theory. The FET biosensor allows rapid (within 20 min) and ultrasensitive PSA detection in human serum with simple operations (limit of detection: 800 fg mL−1). This FET biosensor offers excellent features such as ultrahigh sensitivity, ease of fabrication, and short assay time, and thereby possesses significant potential for early-stage diagnosis of life-threatening diseases.'
