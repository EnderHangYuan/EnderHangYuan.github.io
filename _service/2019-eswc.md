I was a Co-Chair of the [Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC19)](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/) [Research of Research](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/call-for-papers-research-of-research-track/): Semantic Representation, Analysis, and Visualization track.

The other co-chairs were:
- Francesco Osborne, Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK
- Sahar Vahdati, Smart Data Analytics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany

## Description

The main goal of this research track is bringing together the communities relying on semantic approaches for representation, mining, analysis, and visualization of research outputs, such as papers, data, software, experiments, vocabularies, workflows, patents, and others, irrespective of the context of the research, whether academia, industry, or government. In broad terms, the themes of this Research of Research track are: (a) semantic representation of research outputs, i.e. how to semantically represent, categorise, connect, and integrate their representations, in order to foster reusability and knowledge sharing; (b) analysis of research outputs, i.e. approaches for information extraction and retrieval, discovering patterns and predictions through AI approaches, understanding research dynamics, forecasting trends, informing research policies, analysing and interlinking experiments, deriving new knowledge, recommending research outputs; (c) visualization of analytics about research outputs and interaction with scholarly data in order to provide novel user interfaces and applications for navigating and identifying patterns in scholarly outputs.
