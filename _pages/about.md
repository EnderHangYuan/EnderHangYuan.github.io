Brief Introduction
=====
I'm pursuing my B.Eng. degrees in [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/mechatronics-and-robotic-systems) from [University of Liverpool (UoL)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk) and [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) now, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Pengfei Song](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/mechatronics-and-robotics/staff/pengfei-song) and [Assistant Professor Quan Zhang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/mechatronics-and-robotics/staff/quan-zhang). 

I once learned robot hands from [Associate Professor Wenzeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=n-3doEMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the Advanced Robotic Hand Research Laboratory, [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and then completed three utility model patents in the [Tsinghua University Tianjin High-end Equipment Research Institute Luoyang Advanced Manufacturing Industry Research Base Crowdspace](http://www.lamic.com.cn/index.php) as a creator of the crowdspace.
