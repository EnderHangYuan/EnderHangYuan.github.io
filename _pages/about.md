Brief Introduction
=====
I'm pursuing my B.Eng. degrees in [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/mechatronics-and-robotic-systems) from the [University of Liverpool (UoL)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk) and [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) now, under the supervision of [Assistant Professor Pengfei Song](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/mechatronics-and-robotics/staff/pengfei-song). During this period, I am also grateful for the supervision provided by [Professor Xinyu Liu](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=g0O5-8gAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Toronto.

I once learned robot hands from [Associate Professor Wenzeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=n-3doEMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing Technology, [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
