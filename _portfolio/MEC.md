In Vision Robotics Project Vision Robot Recognition Competition (Undergraduate) Project Competition, Our group used robot vision algorithm and tracking algorithm to realize robot autonomous line patrol, color recognition, autonomous shooting and other functions. According to the visual feedback, the gait control of the robot is optimized, and its movement is more coordinated by debugging, so as to achieve a more stable and fast racing performance. In addition, we completed the technical report named "Stability Control and Algorithm Optimization for Intelligent Recognition of Bipedal Robots", and finally won the first prize in China.

Bipedal robots benefit from the support of modern artificial intelligence technology and are widely used and promoted in practice, entering all aspects of social life and gradually becoming a focus of research. Based on the design, debugging and optimization of vision robot competition projects, this paper addresses the design of mechanical structures and software systems of bipedal robots to achieve humanoid postures to complete competition projects such as intelligent identification. The robot vision algorithm and tracing algorithm are used to realize the functions of autonomous patrol, color recognition and autonomous shooting. Based on the visual feedback, the gait control of the robot is optimized and debugged to make its movement more coordinated. Optimize the algorithms for each function based on the impact of external factors on the actual performance of the robot in the actual competition environment. After testing and verification, the robot's anti-interference ability to the external environment is improved, and it has a more stable performance and achieves stable control for the high degree of freedom robot(CN).[Download the paper here](https://github.com/EnderHangYuan/EnderHangYuan.github.io/blob/master/files/03-202103210211388.pdf)![725c81211d9adb652d0acfaff6fefdc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153570646-1454780a-633b-4b19-9b5d-7ccc9ffffd98.jpg)
