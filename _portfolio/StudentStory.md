I am delighted to share that I have been selected for the annual feature in the ["Student Story" series at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/news/2024/05/xuezigushiyuanhang). I am honored to receive this distinction, which is awarded to only one undergraduate student from each school every year.

When I was still in high school in my hometown of Luoyang, I learned about XJTLU through an article by [Prof. Mattheus Kouwenhoven](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/thijs-kouwenhoven) in an astronomy journal. At that time, I studied robotic hands under the guidance of [Prof. Wenzeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n-3doEMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at Tsinghua University. After coming to XJTLU, my interests shifted toward paper-based microfluidics for point-of-care testing under the guidance of [Dr. Pengfei Song](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/PengfeiSong). I have always maintained a strong interest and passion for interdisciplinary fields, and at Michigan State University, I hope to pursue my Ph.D. research focusing on bioelectronics and micro/nanorobotics.

Notes: I hope for your understanding regarding any reading difficulties non-Chinese speakers may encounter, as this official news is only available in Chinese
