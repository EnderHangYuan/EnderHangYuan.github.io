These photos record part of my preparation and participation in the RoboMaster competition included Eastern China Regional, University Championship and Jiangsu Intercollegiate League between 2021-2022.

In the first half of 2022, GMaster was unable to return to school to prepare for RoboMaster because of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Suzhou and Shanghai areas. In May, most of the team members traveled to Changzhou to prepare for the competition with the pressure of upcoming final exams.In early June, I arrived in Changzhou for training. I served as the No. 3 double gun operator in this Eastern China Regional competition.
