In the first half of 2022, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Suzhou and Shanghai areas, GMaster faced challenges in returning to school for RoboMaster preparation. In May, the majority of the team members traveled to Changzhou to prepare for the competition, amidst the pressure of upcoming final exams. By early June, I joined the training in Changzhou, assuming the role of the No. 3 double-gun operator for the Eastern China Regional competition.

In the group stage, we achieved consecutive victories against Sichuan University and Shenyang Aerospace University, both with a score of 2:0. However, we faced a defeat against Harbin Engineering University with a score of 0:2, resulting in a second-place finish in the group. This outstanding performance marked the best result in our university's history.

In the Top 16 stage, we confronted Taiyuan University of Science and Technology. With excellent teamwork and precision in our operations, we secured a thrilling victory of 2:1, propelling us to the Top 8 of the Eastern Region and earning us a spot among the Top 32 teams in the National Competition. Once again, this achievement stands as the highest accomplishment in our school's history.

Although our journey ended in the Top 8, with a loss of 0:2 against Zhejiang University, we take pride in the remarkable progress we made and the history we created during this competition.
