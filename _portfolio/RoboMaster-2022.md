These photos record part of my preparation and participation in the RoboMaster competition included Eastern China Regional, University Championship and Jiangsu Intercollegiate League between 2021-2022.

In the first half of 2022, GMaster was unable to return to school to prepare for RoboMaster because of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Suzhou and Shanghai areas. In May, most of the team members traveled to Changzhou to prepare for the competition with the pressure of upcoming final exams.In early June, I arrived in Changzhou for training. I served as the No. 3 double gun operator in this Eastern China Regional competition.

We have a total of seven robots: a hero robot (#1), an engineering robot (#2), a sentry robot, a two-gun standard robot (#3), a single-gun standard robot (#4), a co-axle McNamee wheel balanced standard robot (backup), and a dart.

In the group stage, we defeated Sichuan University and Shenyang University of Aeronautics and Astronautics respectively by 2:0, and then lost to Harbin Engineering University by 0:2, and came out second in the group. This achievement created the best result in the history of our university. In the battle of Top 16 into Top 8, we played against Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, and with excellent operation and cooperation, we killed our opponent 2:1 and won the Top 8 of the Eastern Region, and the Top 32 places in the National Competition. Once again, the best result in our school's history. After that, we lost to Zhejiang University 0:2 and stopped at the top 8.

GMaster successfully entered the top 32 of the national competition in the first inland competition. We became the "dark horse" team of 2022 competition.

We have received extensive media coverage and publicity. (Because the publicity is all in Chinese, it is only linked and not translated into English) Some of them are listed as follow.
