In the first half of 2022, GMaster was unable to return to school to prepare for RoboMaster because of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Suzhou and Shanghai areas. In May, most of the team members traveled to Changzhou to prepare for the competition with the pressure of upcoming final exams.In early June, I arrived in Changzhou for training. I served as the No. 3 double gun operator in this Eastern China Regional competition.

In the group stage, we defeated Sichuan University and Shenyang Aerospace University respectively by 2:0, and then lost to Harbin Engineering University by 0:2, and came out second in the group. This achievement created the best result in the history of our university. In the battle of Top 16 into Top 8, we played against Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, and with excellent operation and cooperation, we killed our opponent 2:1 and won the Top 8 of the Eastern Region, and the Top 32 places in the National Competition. Once again, the best result in our school's history. After that, we lost to Zhejiang University 0:2 and stopped at the top 8.
