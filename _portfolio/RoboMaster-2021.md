These photos record part of my preparation and participation in the RoboMaster competition included Jiangsu Intercollegiate League and University Championship between 2020-2021.

In April 2021, my teammates and I(The fifth from the left in the first row) took a team photo at our school before the Jiangsu Intercollegiate League.![1644498602402](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153559865-5eebd781-1a4a-4147-9f59-b6824c3ef072.png)

The match was held in the stadium of Nanjing University of Science and Technology. Here are some photos of the stadium.![8ab150274f2ec58bef4306b35fe4c63](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153560444-2ec11c41-eac6-4eb2-b368-669b5f57ad3e.jpg)

I was responsible for the mechanical design of the Sentry robot. The Sentry robot is a fully automated, base guarding robot that moves along a sentry rail. This is the photo of me and the Sentry robot after the competition.![38756515fffd9de2f2405adc5008bf1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153561178-ac9c913d-bd04-4b1d-acac-90018dc4298c.jpg)

In July 2021, we went to Changzhou Guli High-end Equipment Innovation Center for operation training. To save money, we had to transport the robot by train, and this is the picture of the transport.![1644498602314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153561709-284f862e-cb00-4b40-aa24-12116ca6e9e6.jpg)

In Changzhou we had a January training session and I was chosen to operate the infantry robot number five (double muzzleloader). These photos show the scene where the robot was being repaired (I am second from the left) and show all our robots. ![1644498602347](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153562423-70e7430f-612c-4d61-8e75-18f33aed8a2e.jpg)
