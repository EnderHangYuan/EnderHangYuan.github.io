These photos record my preparation and participation in the RoboMaster competition, including University League (Jiangsu Province) and University Championship between 2020-2021.

In April 2021, my teammates and I(The fifth from the left in the first row) took a team photo at our university before the University League (Jiangsu Province).![1644498602402](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153559865-5eebd781-1a4a-4147-9f59-b6824c3ef072.png)

The match was held in the Nanjing University of Science and Technology stadium. Here are some photos of the stadium.![8ab150274f2ec58bef4306b35fe4c63](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153560444-2ec11c41-eac6-4eb2-b368-669b5f57ad3e.jpg)

I was in charge of the mechanical design of the Sentry robot. The Sentry robot is a fully automated base guarding robot that moves along a sentry rail. Here is a photo of me with the Sentry robot after the competition.![38756515fffd9de2f2405adc5008bf1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153561178-ac9c913d-bd04-4b1d-acac-90018dc4298c.jpg)

In July 2021, we went to Changzhou Guli High-end Equipment Innovation Center for operation training. To be cost-effective, we transported the robot by train, and this is a picture of the transportation process.![1644498602314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98693538/153561709-284f862e-cb00-4b40-aa24-12116ca6e9e6.jpg)

During our January training session in Changzhou, I was selected to operate standard robot No.5 (double muzzleloader). These photos depict the scene where the robot was undergoing repairs (I am the second person from the left) and also showcase all of our robots.

In August 2021, we set off from Suzhou, transferred to Jiaxing, and then took the train to Shenzhen, with all the robots traveling alongside us. Despite facing the challenge of a strong typhoon named "Typhoon In-fa," we were undeterred in our pursuit of progress. Implementing rain protection measures for the robots, we successfully arrived in Shenzhen, undeterred by the adverse weather conditions.

In the University Championship, we competed against three universities and achieved two wins and one draw, marking the best result in the history of XJTLU. These photos capture the venue, the check-in stage, and the operation room (second from the left).

Finally, here are group photos of our entire team, with me positioned as the third person from the left in the first row. The realization of any significant endeavor relies on the collaborative efforts of a team, as an individual's strength has its limits. I am truly grateful to my teammates for their invaluable contributions!
