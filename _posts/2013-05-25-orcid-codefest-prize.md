On 23rd May 2013, I participated in the [ORCID CodeFest](http://www.hackathon.io/orcid) and won the first prize to attend the ODIN Codefest in CERN.

My project was about adding support in the ISAcreator Java-based tool to search a user's ORCID and retrieve all their information based on the ORCID API.
