On 23rd May 2013, I participated in the [ORCID CodeFest](http://www.hackathon.io/orcid) (see also the details in the [ORCID website](https://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013)) and won the first prize to attend the ODIN Codefest in CERN.

[My project](https://www.hackathon.io/isacreator) was about adding support to the ISAcreator Java-based tool for searching a user's ORCID and retrieve all their information based on the ORCID API. 

You can read more about the [ORCID codefest](https://isatools.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/orcid-codefest-2013/) and about [my project](https://isatools.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/alejandras-project-wins-the-orcid-codefest-prize/) in these blog post by [Eamonn Maguire](https://twitter.com/antarcticdesign).

In summary, I added code to search for an ORCID record via a dedicated interface:

and then, the user information is automatically added from the ORCID profile:
