On 23rd May 2013, I participated in the [ORCID CodeFest](http://www.hackathon.io/orcid) and won the first prize to attend the ODIN Codefest in CERN.

[My project](https://www.hackathon.io/isacreator) was about adding support to the ISAcreator Java-based tool for searching a user's ORCID and retrieve all their information based on the ORCID API. 

You can read more about what I did in [this blog post by Eamonn Maguire](https://isatools.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/alejandras-project-wins-the-orcid-codefest-prize/).

I added code to search for an ORCID record via a dedicated interface:

and then, the user information is automatically added from the ORCID profile:
