This was the first Data Carpentry workshop run in the UK, and was supported by [ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/).

All the workshop materials are available in this website: [http://apawlik.github.io/2014-11-27-elixiruk-manchester/](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-11-27-elixiruk-manchester/).

I was invited to deliver some of the lessons, and for that purpose prepared the following material:
- [Managing life science experimental data in tables](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-11-27-elixiruk-manchester/isa-tools/experimental-metadata/01-experimental-metadata.html) 
- [Discovery of Metadata Standards and Databases](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-11-27-elixiruk-manchester/isa-tools/experimental-metadata/metadata-standard-discovery.mdmetadata-standard-discovery.html)
and the tools I used for the lessons where described in the [Tool shed](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-11-27-elixiruk-manchester/isa-tools/experimental-metadata/tools-shed.html)
