In April 2019, I taught a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshop at the [Centro Internacional Franco-Argentino de Ciencias de la Informaci√≥n y Sistemas (CIFASIS)](http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/) in Rosario, Argentina. The workshop was entitled "Computational tools for researchers" (in Spanish: *"Herramientas computacionales para investigadores"*).

The content included a mix of software and data carpentry lessons covering Unix shell, python and git. I used the lessons from the Carpentries that had been translated into Spanish.  

The details of the training material are available at [the workshop website](https://agbeltran.github.io/2019-04-25-rosario), where some of the content is in Spanish.
