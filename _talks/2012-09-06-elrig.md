I presented this talk in the [Drug Discovery 2012](https://elrig.org/downloads/dd12/DD12.pdf) conference in Manchester, UK.

This was part of a session about "Knowledge at your fingertips", where we discussed about "cutting edge, open tools for use by scientists to share, find and createinformation and knowledge. In order to effectively locate, interpret, link and cross reference results,information needs to be stored in a rich, standardised, computer friendly formats â€“ these are often humanunfriendly to create and use. Now innovative, opensource tools and standards are emerging which hold thepromise to deliver these advantages in scientist friendly applications."
