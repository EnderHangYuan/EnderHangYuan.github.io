I was invited to presented in the [ExPaNDS project FAIR workshops](https://expands.eu/2020/09/09/expands-fair-workshops-1st-2nd-october-2020/).

[ExPaNDS](https://expands.eu/) stands for the European Open Science (EOSC) Photon and Neutron Data Service and is a project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (under grant agreement 857641). ExPaNDS project is a collaboration between 10 national Photon and Neutron Research Infrastructures (PaN RIs) as well as EGI. The project aims to deliver standardised, interoperable, and integrated data sources and data analysis services for Photon and Neutron facilities. 

The FAIR workshops ran over two days. The first day covered "FAIR for facilities" and the second day was about "The FAIR experiment". 


## Large-scale facilities experimental lifecycle & FAIRness
### Abstract

A discussion on the large-scale facilites experimental lifecycle in the context of the FAIR data principles and FAIR digital objects. What are the implications of FAIR for data management before, during, and after the experiment?  When, where and how during the lifecycle of an experiment do we collect the metadata we need to document data and make it FAIR?
