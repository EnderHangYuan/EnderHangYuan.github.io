### Abstract

A discussion on the large-scale facilites experimental lifecycle in the context of the FAIR data principles and FAIR digital objects. What are the implications of FAIR for data management before, during, and after the experiment?  When, where and how during the lifecycle of an experiment do we collect the metadata we need to document data and make it FAIR?
