I attended the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/events/m4m-workshop/">first Metadata for Machines (M4M) workshop</a> organised by the Research Data Alliance and the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org">GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office</a>.

My talk about "Towards FAIR metadata standards" is available via <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7206518.v1">this DOI</a>, where I described the approach to produce machine-actionable metadata models from descriptions of minimum information checklists available in different forms.
