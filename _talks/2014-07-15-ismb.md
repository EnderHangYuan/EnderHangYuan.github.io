This talk explores how principles derived from experimental design practice, data and computational models can greatly enhance data quality, data generation, data reporting, data publication and data review. For this, I presented a case study on reproducibility that was a collaboration between the GigaScience journal and the ISA-commons, Research Object and Nanopublication communities.
