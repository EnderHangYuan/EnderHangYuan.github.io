As part of the [Ada Lovelace Centre](https://adalovelacecentre.ac.uk/) project "Development of a sustainable and user-friendly software architecture for the Muon Spectroscopy Computational Project", I was part of the [Muon Site Calculation Meeting](https://web.cvent.com/event/9721b662-bfc7-4db1-a5b3-7d97025c17bc/summary) on 4th September 2020.

I gave a talk on "Towards sustainable software for the muon science computational project" and the slides are available in Zenodo:
